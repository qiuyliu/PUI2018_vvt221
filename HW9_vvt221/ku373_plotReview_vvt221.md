# PLOT REVIEW

![main plot](Image/Picture_for_Assignment.png)

## CLARITY:

* The plot captures all the essential information in a very minimimalistic manner.

* The plot makes efficient use of geometry to distinguish between the actual and the projected growth.

* It is a very concise plot which conveys maximum information with a very clean design style.


## ESTHETICS:

* The use of black and grey color is ingenious, even though it was chosen to benefit people suffering from color blindness.

* The plot is functionally sound and is successful in driving home its message.



## HONESTY:

* I feel percentages are an abstraction of the actual values. It would be better if this graph was complemented with the orignal values of the population to make the message more clear. For instance, Manhattan's population may already be more than Brooklyn's so the slow drop does not really affect its size.
